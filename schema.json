// Note: As this is JSON, the order of fields doesn't matter in requests; 
//chere they're listed in the order they appear when a GET request is made 
// from the server. 

// Note: Every object has an 'id' and 'resource_uri' field which can be included
// or not as needed; they default to null if not used

// CARD SCHEMA
// A card is the basic unit of the id card system. There can be multiple 
// cards under one UTLN. The 'active' ID card is determined by the single card
// that is linked to the user account of the UTLN.

// A user account is the thing with which we will hopefully authenticate,

// ACTIONS WHICH CAN BE MADE:

// User views their ID card:
// GET request for user_account with utln equal to the user's UTLN
// extract active ID card URI (e.g. /api/v1/card/4) from user_account data
// GET request for active ID card
// display card information

// User creates a new card request:
// POST request to create new card given information user enters
// POST request to create new request linking new card to user account (access_points field in request should be blank)

// User views access points:
// GET request for user_account with utln equal to the user's UTLN
// extract array of access points from user_account data
// for each access point URI in the array:
//     GET request for the access point
//     display the access point information

// User creates a new request for access to an access point:
// POST request to create a new request linking new access point(s) to user account

// User views their requests:
// GET request for requests with UTLN equal to user's UTLN
// for each request URI in resulting array:
//     GET request for request object
//     Display the request

// User/Manager updates a request:
// GET request for request object
// read fields, display for user, make new request object when they submit
// PUT request to request object

// User attempts to view manager page:
// GET request for user_account with utln equal to the user's UTLN
// If manager_level field is greater than 1, allow access, otherwise error

// Manager views request queue:
// GET requests with request_level less than / equal to the manager level of the user
// For each request:
//     Display request data

// Manager accepts request:
// GET request for the request
// GET request for associated user account
// If request_level == 1:
//      GET request for associated new_access_points
//      make new user object with access_points = new_access_points
//      PUT request to user account, sending new object over
// If request_level == 2:
//     GET request for associated new_card
//     make new user object with card = new_card
//     PUT request to user account, sending new object over
// make new request object, with status = 1, message = "Accepted" (or a real message?)
// PUT request to request object, sending new object over

// Manager rejects request:
// GET request for the request
// make new request object, with status = 2 or 3, message = "Rejected" or a real message
// PUT request to request object, sending new object over
